0x02. Math - Integrals and ODE
 By Mohamed Amine BEN AMOR, Khaoula DEROUICHE & Vincent ROESSLE

In this section we will have only a quick idea about integrals. We will use loops and functions in order to calculate the integral of some functions. We will focus on two numerical methods: Rectangle and Simpson.

Tasks
0. Rectangle Method
Code the Rectangle Method and use it to calculate 
    float a = 0.0;
    float b = 1.0;
    int steps = 1000000;
    printf("The Rectangle approximation of the Integral is : %.9f\n", rectangle_integral);


1. Simpson Method
Code the Simpson Method and use it to calculate 
    float a = 0.0;
    float b = 1.0;
    int steps = 7;
    simpon_integral = simpson(a, b, steps);
    printf("The Simpson approximation of the Integral is: %.9f\n", simpon_integral);
    printf("The exact value is:                           %.9f\n", 3.1415926535 / 4);

The Simpson approximation of the Integral is: 0.759888051
The exact value is:                           0.785398163


2. Simple Pendulum - part 1
Code the Euler Method to solve the ODE , with initial values  and 

You should add the result of Euler Method to a .txt file.
Hint: You will have n values for x and n values for y and the divisions will have the value 

    FILE *euler = NULL;
    Euler(euler, "euler1.txt", -2, 2, 0.5, 10000);
    Euler(euler, "euler2.txt", 2, -2, -0.5, 1000);
        return (0);

The output of the code should be the two txt files: euler1.txt and euler2.txt. Each line of the file will contain the value of x, tab (\t) then the value of y like the following example:


3. Simple Pendulum - part 2
With Gnuplot, plot the solution of the Pendulum equation with  and return the result in the file ode.png using mutiple .txt files generated by using the Euler method of previous task.
